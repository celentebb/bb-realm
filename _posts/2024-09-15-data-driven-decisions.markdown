For each goal you have in the game, you have to play a different kind of game. For example: if you are aiming to complete "Bounty Bay", where you have to achieve a certain amount of XP, you have to play Bonus games, where you can get more XPs, games like: Inspector Groovy or Blitzy Daub Home. So you need to know which boost is the best for the amount of credits you have.
