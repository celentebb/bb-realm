There are plenty websites that explains the basics of the game. So here we will focus mainly in tips and strategies.
I have to mention though, i will post most of the collectibles of the game (by room).

## VERY IMPORTANT

- All tips and recommendations are for playing with *4 cards* and *Classic boost*

## What do you get in a map room?

- Daub Alerts (Deprecated 2024, no longer in use)
- Daily Credits (When you complete a milestone)
- Rare Power Ups (Triple Daubs, Double Daubs, Wild Daub, when you complete the first milestone in each island)

## How longer does it takes to complete a map room?

- You can complete 1 room between 1 hour and 3 days. (Playing 3 - 6 hours a day).
- The harder rooms i've been took me 3 days to complete (but jumping between Map and Seasonal Games).
- Note: there's a lot of people complaining to be "trapped" in a room for weeks. That has never happened to me. Never.

## What are milestones?

- You reach a milestone when you complete certain amount of unique collectibles in map rooms.

1. Milestone 1: 40 Power Ups (10 triple daub, 10 double daub, 10 wild, and another that i dont know)
2. Milestone 2: 800 credits.
3. Milestone 3: 55 daily credits.

## When is it necessary to play on the map?

- When you need any of the prizes that you can get from the milestones.

## Tips?

- If you are not plawing for a red tab, if you don't use double daubs nor chargers, you'll get some in the chests.
- When you're short on power ups is better to play map rooms or collect power ups on the mini games (see Power Ups post).
- You can trade HTG (hard to get items) for food or seasonal items in rooms that you already completed.
